## vbXML 0\.03


</div>

### Description

vbXML 0.03 : The latest and greatest vbXML release. I basically just added a new example (removing the two old ones) that will go with vbXML untill the end. The example is stable, I think, and for now just shows some of the most basic features. Expect more feature showoff in 0.04. Sorry, but I didnt add the skin support that I wanted to add, but I did fix a few arguments in some functions (allowing arrays of attributes to be created instead of just two). I updated the Readme, as I should have, and now covers everything except what to expect in 0.04. I am going to hold off a bit for the next release so I can get some other stuff done.
